# ritV
With an unfortunate rise of threats towards RIT's online communities, **`ritV`** stands as a joint line of defense against malicious activity. This system has been used by over 350 students, and has stood in the way of over 50 malicious accounts. Currently, this system is used on Discord, however, it can be expanded to other platforms too.

## What it can do
- Verify that incoming community members are RIT students
- Verify that no member's email is ever reused
- Immediately ban known malicious accounts without human intervention

## In attackers' way, not yours.
ritV has a shared verification system - meaning that once your email is verified through one RIT community, there's no need to do it again.
