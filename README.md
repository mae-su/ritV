# ritV - An RIT Email Verification Bot
With an  rise of threats towards RIT's online communities, **`ritV`** stands as a joint line of defense against malicious activity through email verification. This system has been used by over 350 students, and has stood in the way of over 50 malicious accounts. Currently, this system is used on Discord, however, it can be expanded to other platforms too.

## What it does
- Verify that incoming community members are RIT students
- Verify that no member's email is ever reused

## In harm's way, not yours.
ritV has a shared verification system - meaning that once your email is verified through one RIT community, there's no need to do it again.
